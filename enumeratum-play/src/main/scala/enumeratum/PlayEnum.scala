/**
  * An Enum that has a lot of the Play-related implicits built-in so you can avoid
  * boilerplate.
  *
  * Note, the binders created here are case-sensitive.
  *
  * Things included are:
  *
  *   - implicit JSON format
  *   - implicit PathBindable (for binding from request path)
  *   - implicit QueryStringBindable (for binding from query strings)
  *   - formField for doing things like `Form("hello" -> MyEnum.formField)`
